# Precision XY Gantry System for X-ray Diffraction Mammography

![Gantry System](./images/hero.png)

## üìå Overview

This project is part of the development of a next-generation **4D mammography system** that incorporates **X-ray diffraction imaging** to extract **tissue density** data‚Äîaiming to drastically reduce false positives in breast cancer detection.

The XY gantry system was designed to **precisely position an X-ray filter** along two axes to scan and reconstruct a full diffraction image. The positioning stage required **sub-millimeter accuracy**, low vibration, and mechanical stability for reliable data acquisition.

## üß† Problem Statement

Conventional mammography has an alarmingly high false-positive rate, leading to unnecessary biopsies and patient anxiety. The company I worked with is pioneering a **4D imaging system**, where the fourth dimension‚Äî**density**‚Äîis derived using **X-ray diffraction**.

To extract diffraction data, the system needs to **position an X-ray filter** in the XY plane with extreme precision. Off-the-shelf solutions were too large, imprecise, or prohibitively expensive for integration into a compact medical device.

## ‚öôÔ∏è My Role & Contributions

- **Evaluated drive mechanisms** (belt vs. screw) for precision and vibration resistance
- **Selected dual T8 lead screws** to optimize for accuracy, backlash elimination, and mechanical simplicity
- **Designed the XY gantry frame** using aluminum extrusions, stepper motor mounts, and custom brackets
- **Iterated on linear rail support**: switched from a single rail to **dual linear guide rails** after observing deflection and instability in initial prototype
- **Performed FEA analysis** in Fusion 360 to validate structural stiffness of dual-rail design
- **Manufactured all mechanical components**:
  - CNC machining for metal motor mounts and end brackets
  - 3D printing for rapid prototyping and test fitting
